}

0


1


2


3

Check Answer
a.length = 5
             A[0] = a[(0 + 3) % 5] = a[3] = 1
             So, a[0] =  a[3] = 1
             A[1] = a[(2 + 3) % 5] = a[0] = 1

4


None

Check Answer
Using the new keyword creates an object everytime. Hence, 2 objects are created for first two statement. Next, a string is declared which creates another object. For the fourth statement, since, a string ”Interviewbit” already exists, it doesn’t create an additional object again. Hence, answer is 3.
